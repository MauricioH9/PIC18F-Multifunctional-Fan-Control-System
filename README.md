# PIC18F-Multifunctional-Fan-Control-System
In this project, I implemented a multifunctional fan control system using a PIC18F microcontroller, featuring a TFT display, temperature sensor, and real-time clock (RTC) for a user-friendly interface. The system supports fan control, ambient temperature display, digital clock, and alarm functionality, all controlled via an IR remote. The system components involve GPIOS, PWM, I2C, IR Remote, and Interrupts. The main screen displays the current temperature, time, date, fan status, and alarm settings. The fan operation automatically adjusts the fan speed based on ambient temperature. The fan can also be manually controlled through the remote. The alarm system activates a multicolor LED and buzzer when the alarm time is reached, and can be disabled using the remote or light sensor.
