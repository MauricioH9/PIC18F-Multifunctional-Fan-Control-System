# PIC18F-Multifunctional-Fan-Control-System
In this project I implemented a multifunctional fan control system using a PIC18F microcontroller, featuring a TFT display, temperature sensor, and real-time clock (RTC) for a user-friendly interface. The system supports fan control, ambient temperature display, digital clock, and alarm functionality, all controlled via an IR remote. The system components involve the use of GPIOS, PWM, I2C, IR Remote, and Interrupts. The main screen
